# Handshake
## Description
Keep in touch with those too far away for a simple handshake! Handshake allows you and your friends to remotely control a
handshake robot via a web interface to interact with friends beyond just a screen or video call! 

## Getting Started
1) Log in at https://handshake-664b7.firebaseapp.com/
2) Enter the 5-character ID displayed on the robot's screen to connect. Looks like `XX:XX`
## Technologies
The Handshake Robot is designed with an ESP32, SH1106 mini OLED display, and 2 SG90 9g continuous Micro Servos. 
These robots connect to the Handshake server hosted with Firebase where users can interact with a web interface built with React JS, and Vite.
